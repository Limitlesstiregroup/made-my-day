## Post-GA Sustainment
- 105%: Incident replay fixture expansion for malformed intermediary traffic ✅
- 110%: Idempotency cache schema versioning + deploy-time auto-migration guard ✅

- 115%: Incident replay fixture expansion for malformed `x-request-id` + `x-forwarded-prefix` patterns ✅
- 120%: Error-response cache hardening (cached JSON helpers disable ETag/304 + force no-store on 4xx/5xx) ✅
- 125%: Allowed-host policy hardening (GA readiness now fails duplicate host entries to prevent drifted ingress allowlists) ✅
- 130%: Health-details runtime guard expansion adds explicit capacity usage ratios (stories/comments/rate-limit/idempotency) for earlier saturation detection in GA incidents ✅
- 135%: Health-version runtime telemetry now includes process CPU usage (`cpuUserMicros`, `cpuSystemMicros`) for faster saturation triage during GA incidents ✅
- 140%: Health-version runtime telemetry now includes process resource pressure counters (`fsReadBytes`, `fsWriteBytes`, `voluntaryContextSwitches`, `involuntaryContextSwitches`) for faster incident saturation attribution ✅
- 145%: Health-version runtime telemetry now includes event-loop pressure counters (`eventLoopUtilization`, `eventLoopActiveMillis`, `eventLoopIdleMillis`) for faster saturation triage under CPU-adjacent but non-CPU-bound incidents ✅
- 150%: Safe-method body-framing hardening rejects `GET`/`HEAD` requests carrying request-body framing (`Content-Length > 0` or any `Transfer-Encoding`) to reduce request-smuggling/cache ambiguity on safe routes ✅
- 155%: Timeout-ordering hardening now fails GA readiness when `BODY_READ_TIMEOUT_MS` exceeds `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, preventing slow-body timeout drift beyond intended request lifetime bounds ✅
- 160%: Body-read safety-gap hardening now fails GA readiness when `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` is less than 1000ms above `BODY_READ_TIMEOUT_MS`, preserving deterministic post-body processing headroom during load spikes ✅
- 165%: Header-timeout safety-gap hardening now fails GA readiness when `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` is less than 1000ms above `HEADERS_TIMEOUT_MS`, preserving deterministic response flush headroom during slow-header and keep-alive churn ✅
- 170%: Content-Type duplication hardening now rejects duplicate `Content-Type` header lines on JSON mutation/admin POST APIs with HTTP 400 to prevent intermediary/header-fold ambiguity ✅
- 175%: Content-Encoding duplication hardening now rejects duplicate/comma-joined `Content-Encoding` values on JSON mutation/admin POST APIs with HTTP 400 before body parsing to prevent intermediary/header-fold ambiguity ✅
- 180%: Authorization + idempotency header-duplication hardening now rejects duplicate raw `Authorization` headers on admin endpoints and duplicate raw `Idempotency-Key` headers on JSON mutation/admin POST APIs with HTTP 400 to prevent intermediary/header-fold ambiguity ✅
- 185%: Connection persistence hardening now rejects conflicting `Connection: keep-alive, close` directives with HTTP 400 to prevent ambiguous hop-by-hop persistence negotiation through intermediaries ✅
- 190%: Accept header duplication hardening now rejects duplicate raw `Accept` header lines with HTTP 400 (`invalid accept header`) before route handling to prevent intermediary/header-fold ambiguity across all endpoints ✅
- 195%: Content-Length duplication hardening now rejects duplicate raw `Content-Length` header lines with HTTP 400 (`invalid content-length header`) before route handling to eliminate same-value duplicate framing ambiguity across intermediaries ✅
